LearningTrees

Bundle to provide Tree based Machine Learning algorithms.

This bundle will ultimately support all of the major Tree-based learning
algorithms such as:
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting Trees

The current version 1.0 supports Random Forest for classification
(see ClassificationForest.ecl) and regression (see RegressionForest.ecl).

Other algorithms will be added in future versions.
